        <p>
          ALTUM was born in Colorado, where long approaches, bluebird days, and star-lit nights are part of the weekly rhythm.
          We build and curate products for that lifestyle — gear that holds up on the trail, power that keeps you connected
          off-grid, and candles that bring the feeling of the mountains home with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our first collection is simple on purpose:
        </p>

        <ul class="altum-about-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Adventure pants</strong> that move with you from crag to coffee shop.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Portable solar panels</strong> for charging phones, lights, and cameras wherever you camp.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Small-batch, Colorado-made candles</strong> that turn your home into basecamp.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Every product is chosen — or created — because we use it ourselves in the Front Range and beyond.

        <h2 class="altum-about-name">Killian</h2>
        <p class="altum-about-role">Co-Founder</p>
        <p>
          Killian grew up in New Jersey but traded the coast for Colorado’s high country. What started as “one trip out west”
          turned into a permanent move fueled by climbing, hiking, and snow-covered peaks. At ALTUM, he obsesses over the details
          that make gear feel just right — how pants move, how solar packs down, and how a candle’s scent can instantly bring you
          back to a favorite campsite.

        <h2 class="altum-about-name">Dan</h2>
        <p class="altum-about-role">Co-Founder</p>
        <p>
          Dan is originally from Minnesota and moved to Colorado in 2016 for the mountains and the wide-open spaces he’d always
          dreamed about. When he’s not climbing or exploring new trails, he’s testing gear and crafting small-batch soy candles
          in the ALTUM studio — blending scents like Black Rose + Oud to capture the feeling of Colorado nights.

      <h2 class="altum-about-why-heading">Why we started ALTUM</h2>
      <p>
        We wanted gear and goods that felt as intentional as the days we spend outside: pants that move with you, solar that keeps
        the essentials powered, and candles that turn your home into basecamp. ALTUM is our way of blending those worlds —
        the heights of adventure and the depths of comfort.
